# Spam-Detection
Email Spam Detection using NLP
This notebook walks through building a Spam Detection System for Emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning.

It explores three approaches, with a focus on the statistical method using TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) and classification with Logistic Regression.
